# gif-search

This is an app that produces gifs of video games. 

There are already some premade buttons that shows you 10 gifs of that video game. 

If you want to add more buttons, you can type in the name and hit the submit button. 

The gifs are still, but if you click on the gif image it will animate. You can click on it again to stop it. 

Andrew Park contributes and maintains this project.
