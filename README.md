# gif-search

This is an app that produces gifs of video games. 

There are already some premade buttons that shows you 10 gifs of that video game. 

If you want to add more buttons, you can type in the name and hit the submit button. 

If you want more than the default 10 gifs to display, click on the dropdown to display either 20, 30, or 40 gifs.

You can add a favorite button by typing the term in the input field then clicking the "Add Favorite" button. This input will be stored in your local storage. If you want to clear all your favorites, click the "Clear Favorites" button. 

***(Future additions: In addition to clearing all favorites, maybe add a function that can clear only selected favorites or submissions. Maybe create a checkbox for each button and clicking a button will clear the ones that are checked.

Will organize button and input field placements in the future. Looks kinda odd to me.)***

The gifs are still, but if you click on the gif image it will animate. You can click on it again to stop it.
